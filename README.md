# Turkey Hill Red Oak Project
This repository includes nitrogen data for 2022 Red Oak (*Quercus rubra* L.) leaves. 

Foliage was collected from mature (80yrs) and intermediately aged (30-40yrs) trees, as well as seedlings. Both primary leaves, which were produced in late April, and secondary leaves, which were produced in early August were collected. Collected leaves were dried for 48 hours at 60 degrees Celcius. 

Leaves were ground using a standard coffee grinder, and analyzed at the Cornell Stable Isotope Laboratory in March 2023. This data set contains only percent nitrogen information. Further data will explore the non-structural carbohydrate content.
